Learning Git and Github!
========================
Subheadline
-----------

This is a footnote[^1].

Version control is an **essential skill** for _developers_ to master, and ~~Git~~ is by far the most popular version control system on the web. In this fast-paced course, author Ray Villalobos `shows` you how to install Git and use the fundamental commands you need to work with Git projects: moving files, managing logs, and working with branches.
***
> Plus, you'll [learn](https://linkedinlearning.com) how to work with the popular GitHub website to explore existing projects, clone them to your local hard drive, and use them as templates for your new projects.
